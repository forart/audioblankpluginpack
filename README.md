AudioBlank Plugin Pack consists of VST and JS plugins which don't do any audio processing. However, they have neat GUI which simulate a Music/Audio hardware.

AudioBlank Marshall MG15-CD graphically simulates Guitar amplifier Marshall MG 15 CD. It does not process the audio in any way. But it's useful for keeping the amp configuration while miking the amp.

We tweak the knobs and switches in the actual amp (EQ, Volumes, Overdrive/Clean, FDD on/off etc.) to get the desired the sound and mic the amp. If we want to continue the same recording later, we have to recreate the same settings in the amp. Otherwise we can not achieve the same tone.

Once you are happy with your tone in the amp, before hitting record * Insert AudiobBlank Marshall MG15-CD in the track * Tweak the plugin so that it reflects your actual settings in the amp. * Hit record

Your host will save the settings along with the plugin. Later if you wish to continue the same track, fire up the plugin from the track, set your amp according to the plugin.
